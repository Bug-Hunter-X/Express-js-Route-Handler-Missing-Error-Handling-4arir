# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to parse a user ID from a request parameter without checking if the ID is a valid integer.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes if the ID is not an integer.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code that includes error handling to gracefully handle invalid user IDs.  It checks if the ID is a valid integer and returns a 404 error if not found.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Express.js applications to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure the stability of the application.
